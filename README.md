# SudokuSolver

## Installation for Android

To Install the app, just search for the APK file in the root directory. You maybe have to deactivate the Play-Protect Services on your device.

## Features

1. **Fully customizable color-appearance**  
    Background-, main- and marker-color are changable in order to fit to your preferences.
    All black background possible (helps to save battery on OLED devices)

1. **Adjust the solving speed**  
    If you want to see and understand how the algorithm works, you can slow down the process. 
    For only solving a sudoku, the speed can get turned up massively.
    
1. **History**  
    Who likes to type in the sudoku, you typed in 5 minutes ago? Nobody, so a history feature is implemented to reinsert old sudokus. (disclaimer: not implemented yet)
